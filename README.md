# PowerBI-1
This learning project in Power BI provided a solid foundation in basic chart creation and manipulation. Understanding Column Charts, Clustered Column Charts, Pie Charts, Donut Charts, Funnel Charts, and functionalities like include and exclude has equipped me with essential skills for visualizing data effectively. Additionally, learning how to view data and export CSV adds versatility to my data analysis toolkit.

Thank you for exploring the Power BI Basics Learning Project!
